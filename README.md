## Next Steps
- [x] code is running
- [ ] How many tokens to run the code
- [x] Create webpage with input and output (local)
    - [x] ran simple python code using flask. flask framework is needed to run python code and call from html (i think). This was done in flask folder with app.py
    - [x] use learnings from app.py, and apply it to llm model. 
- [x] Codepipline deployed?
- [x] host this on a server
    - 1. Make sure code runs locally.
    - 2. gitignore file required. 
    - 3. code pipeline -> elastic beanstalk
        - Create app and env in beanstalk. then setup code pipeline connection with github and deploy in beanstalk
    - 4. [video1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BoVhej0QVI)[video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tDjVFbi31o)
